# check-lock-sync.sh — verify .github/workflows/actions.lock is in sync with the
# workflow YAML, in BOTH directions, including job-level reusable-workflow refs.
#
# This is the estate-wide template from hyperpolymath/standards for issue #968.
# Adapted from metadatastician/burble#224.
#
# Why this exists rather than `gh actions-lock --verify-local` alone:
#   `gh actions-lock` v0.1.6 cannot see a job-level `uses:` (a reusable-workflow
#   call); v0.2.0 still cannot (re-measured 2026-10-14). Measured on this repo, 2026-09-22:
#     * mirror.yml's lock entry was stale by a whole SHA and died at startup with
#       jobs=0, yet --verify-local reported "All 30 workflows have complete
#       lockfile coverage" and fix mode did not repair it;
#     * release.yml's job-level slsa-github-generator ref was absent from the
#       lock, again unreported; and once added, --verify-local calls it `stale`
#       with "no uses: in this workflow references it" — about a ref on line 144.
#   GitHub's own startup enforcement DOES check those refs (that is what killed
#   mirror.yml), so the tool is wrong in both directions and cannot be the
#   authority. This script is.
#
# A workflow's `uses:` set includes the `uses:` of every LOCAL composite action
# it calls (`uses: ./.github/actions/x`), transitively: a local action has no
# dependency record of its own, so its actions are locked under the calling
# workflow, which is where `gh actions-lock` writes them (standards#1122).
#
# Exit 0 only when every workflow's `uses:` set equals its lockfile set exactly.
# Any mismatch exits 1. There is no warn-only mode: a desync means GitHub will
# refuse to start the run, so it must fail the job.
# Requires Bash 4+, jq and Mike Farah yq v4; see docs/actions-lock-validation.adoc.
